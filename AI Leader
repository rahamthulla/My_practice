A company has successfully moved past the initial exploration phase by using a small, informal "innovation team" to build several successful generative AI proofs-of-concept (PoCs). The executive leadership has now approved a strategic initiative to build the company's first production-grade, customer-facing AI agent.
What is the most appropriate next step for organizing the team to ensure the success of this pilot project?
=> Establish a formal, dedicated project team with a mix of business and technical roles, clear goals, and executive sponsorship.

A startup wants to be the first to market with an AI-powered application for generating creative fiction stories. To achieve maximum speed, they build their application on a highly-managed, third-party "no-code" AI platform. This platform simplifies development but only provides access to a single, general-purpose language model and limited user interface components.
What is the primary strategic risk of this decision at the Platform layer?
=> Their ability to innovate and differentiate their Application in the future will be constrained by the platform's limitations.
