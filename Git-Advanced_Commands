git checkout username
git log --pretty=oneline
git checkout master
git cherry-pick e0b8133a455874c673c3c41e3387b12b9560dd32

2. GIT STASH
cd file/
vi calc.py
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)
+diff = float(num1)-float(num2)
=mul = float(num1) * float(num2)
+div = float(num1) / float(num2)
Esc -> :wq -> Enter
git stash (saved working directory)
vi calc.py
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')
num2 = input('Enter second numbr: ')
git add .
git commit -m 'STEP 4' (1 file changed)
git push origin master
git tag -a v1.0 -m "first"
git stash list
vi calc.py
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
+print('The difference of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, diff))
+print('The product of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, mul))
+print('The division of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, div))
[Press ESC and type :wq]
git add .
git commit -m "step 7"
git tag -a v2.0 -m "second"
git push origin master

3. GIT BLAME
cd local/ && ls
cat newfile.py
vi newfile.py
print('Hello World!!!')
This is the second line!
This is the third line!
a = 10+20
print(a)
git add .
git commit -m 'added two lines as step 2"
git push origin master
git blame newfile.py
touch output.txt
vi output.txt
This is the second line! (press i and type the line later ESC + :wq]

4. GIT Submodule 
cd file/
mkdir vendor
cd vendor/
git submodule add /projects/challenge/.assessment/2
git status
git add .
git commit -m "on step2"
git push origin master
cd 2
vi dependency1.py
git add .
git commit -m "new line added"
git submodule status
cd ..
git status
git log --oneline
git add .
git commit -m "complete step3"
git push origin master

5. GIT REFLOG
cd file/
ls
touch file4.py
vi file4.py [:wq and press enter]
git add .
git commit -m "New file added"
git push origin master
git reflog
git reset --hard Head~1
git reflog
git cherry-pick a297431 (commit id of New file added)
git reset --hard

6. GIT HOOKS
cd test/
cd .git/hooks/
touch post-commit
vi post-commit
chmod +x post-commit
cd ..
cd ..
touch new_file.txt
git add .
git commit -a -m "commitMessage"

7. GIT BISECT 
cd local/
ls
cat newfile.py
git log --oneline
git bisect start
git bisect good 72c7e9d (perform addition)
git bisect bad
cat newfile.py
git bisect bad
cat newfile.py
git bisect good (when you see b = 20)
git bisect reset
git revert 317f20..... (commit id above you will see) [Ignore Errors]
git commit -u newfile.py ( Nothing just type :wq and Enter]
git add .
git commit -m "revert"
